Classic BUGS examples
---------------------

Some of the BUGS examples have been modified to run with JAGS, and have
been turned into a test suite.

Each subdirectory contains a number of JAGS script files named test1.cmd,
test2.cmd, ... etc. designed to run the examples as they were presented
in the classic BUGS examples book.

Volume 1 also contains R script files test1.R, test2.R to run the
examples using the rjags interface from JAGS to R.

Some of the examples have been modified. In such cases, there is a
ReadMe file explaining the changes. Some examples cannot be run at all,
and these are obviously not included in the testing process.

make check  Will run all the examples and check the results against
            the benchmark run.  The check ensures that the posterior
            mean of the monitored nodes is not more than 0.15 standard
            deviations away from the benchmark mean. This is a heuristic
            test that could probably be improved.

make Rcheck (Volume 1 only) Runs examples using the rjags interface.

make checktime Runs all the examples and records the times in the file
            "times" (replacing any existing file). The "times"
            file records the directory name, the name of the command
            file and the number of seconds in user mode and kernel
            mode in separate columns.

            This requires the GNU version of time.

make clean  Cleans up any files that may have been created during
            make check, or during debugging

make bench  Creates new benchmark results

make distclean Deletes the benchmark results
